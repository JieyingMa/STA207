# Investigation on Grade 1 Math Scores of Different Class Types

## 1. Introduction
How class size can affect the quality of teaching and the performance of students is always a hot topic in education. Schools can rationalize class sizes to achieve the best teaching and learning outcomes. Many researches based on the STAR experiment show that small classes have both the short-term impacts (e.g., test score improvement, grade retention reduction) and long-term impacts (e.g., higher graduation rate from high school, lager participation in college entrance exam) on students.[1] In this study, we focus on whether class types effect students math scores in grade 1. And if there is an effect, which class types is related to the highest grade 1 math scores.

## 2. Background
The STAR study investigated the impact of class size on student achievement in Tennessee, using a randomized design to place students in various class sizes from kindergarten through third grade. This section outlines the study's planning, design, and implementation, detailing the random assignment of students and teachers to classes of different sizes to assess the effects on academic performance and development. It highlights the structured approach to eliminate systematic bias, ensuring the reliability of findings on the importance of class size in educational outcomes.

## 3. Descriptive Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of the STAR dataset shows significant findings on class size effects, student demographics, and academic performance, with an emphasis on grade 1 math scores.

### 3.1 Uni-variate Descriptive Statistics
The section presents a detailed statistical breakdown of the students' grade 1 performance, highlighting class size, demographic distributions, and score normalization due to missing data.

### 3.2 Data Aggregation
Focusing on class-level data aggregation, this part examines the distribution and impact of various factors, including class size and teacher characteristics, on class average math scores.

### 3.3 Caveats in Data
Acknowledges limitations in the study's implementation, including deviations from the experimental design and the handling of missing class data and mislabeling of class sizes.

### 3.4 Multivariate Description
This section explores the complex relationships between class average math scores, class types, school IDs, and urbanicity, revealing significant disparities and associations.

## 4 Inferential Analysis
Utilizing Two-Way ANOVA and Tukey’s range test, this part provides an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing student math scores, supporting the positive impact of smaller class sizes.

## 5 Sensitivity Analysis
Evaluates the model’s robustness, confirming its validity through residual analysis and sensitivity testing of additional variables, further justifying the model's assumptions and results.

## 6 Discussion
Summarizes key insights from the analysis, emphasizing the benefits of smaller class sizes on student performance and the influence of school and teacher characteristics on educational outcomes.
